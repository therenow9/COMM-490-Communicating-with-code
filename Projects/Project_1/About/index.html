    <p>Hello and Welcome to our website for our show Whatcha Playin? which we hosted on WXSU. We ran the show in the
        fall semester of 2021 and had a total of about 10 episodes. I recorded all the episodes using audacity and have
        them posted as podcasts. Although, the show has been discontinued this semester, I look back fondly on doing the
        show, and was glad to meet David and be able to work with him on this really cool and unique experience.</p>
