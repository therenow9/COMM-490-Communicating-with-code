    <p>Hello and Welcome to our website for our show Whatcha Playin? The episodes have all been recorded all the
        episodes using audacity and have been
        posted
        as podcasts (these can be found in the episodes section). Although, the show has been discontinued this
        semester, I look back fondly on doing the show, and
        was glad
        to meet David and be able to work with him on this really cool and unique experience.</p>
