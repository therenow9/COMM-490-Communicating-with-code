    <p>WXSU is Salisbury University’s Student run and student managed radio station. You can listen to it on the radio
        at 96.3
        around the Salisbury area, OR listen to it line on WXSU’s caster fm site. There are a lot of great people in
        WXSU and it
        was a great experience to do the club. If you are thinking aobut joining WXSU you definitely should go to a
        meeting or 2 to give it a try because it is a whole lot of fun I would like to give a special thanks to some of
        our Managers ,to TJ for
        letting
        us shadow with him to get our show, to Sam for helping us out with some questions and direction on how we should
        record
        the show, and finally a big thanks to Connor, for helping us deal with getting the music track list imported
        into the
        system and helping us navigate the copyright and licensing issues. You can find link’s to WXSU’s website,
        caster fm, and social medias
