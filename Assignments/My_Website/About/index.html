    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img src="../Images/Rj_and_I.jpg" class="picture-RJ" alt="">
    <p>Hello and welcome to my website. A little bit about me, I am a college senior
        finishing up my
        last semester at Salisbury University, I am receiving my Bachelor’s degree in Communications Media Production
        with a
        minor in Computer Science. I have quite the passion for everything Computer Science, networking, IT,
        programming, and
        everything in between! The last few years I have been teaching myself all that I can in my free time and in
        University
        Classes. It all started the summer after my freshman year, when I got an itch for game development after being
        inspired
        by Nintendo’s Earthbound game series. After this, I knew I wanted to learn more about tech, and this is what
        started my
        journey into this wonderful and ever evolving field and I haven’t stopped pursuing tech since. Immediately
        following my
        graduation in May 2022, I will be starting my Master’s program in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance at
        Western
        Governor’s University.</p>
